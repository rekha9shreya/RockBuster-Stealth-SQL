# RockBuster-Stealth-SQL
RockBuster-Stealth-SQL is a presentation I created for the business managers at RockBuster Stealth using SQL Queries. I wrote and prepared data outputs, and also prepared a data dictionary. 

## Objectives 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores all around the world. However, facing stiff competition from big streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime the Rockbuster management team decided to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. In this project, I was hired as a data analyst to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. 

## Key Questions 
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. what was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data 
The RockBuster Data Set - This dataset was created by CareerFoundry to use for this analysis. The data set includes information about RockBuster such as staff, inventory, film names, film languages, customers, rental history, payment history, and addresses for staff members and customers. 

## Tools 
To analyze the data, I used PostgreSQL. I also used Tableau to create visualizations and Excel to filter the dataset. 

## Visualizations
All visualizations that I created and used for this project may be viewed in the attached [Tableau Workbook](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rekha.chapagain/viz/RockbusterStealthAnalysis_17051228220760/Story1)
